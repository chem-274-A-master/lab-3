    "## Modeling More Complicated Systems - Extending the \"force field\"\n",

    "<h3>Do I need to understand this?</h3>\n",
    "    \n",
    "The information in this box is provided to give you a deeper understanding of how molecular dynamics simulations work.\n",
    "However, you do not need to understand all of it, as Dr. Nash has set up the system with appropriate forcefield parameters for you!\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed that our simulation this time is much more complicated than our previous simulations. \n",
    "For example, we now have multiple atom types and we have bonds in our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that our expression for the potential energy has more terms.  \n",
    "In molecular mechanics, the full expression of this model is often called a **force field**  and is a function which describes the potential energy of a system. \n",
    "In our previous simulations, we could describe our system energy using the Lennard Jones equation only. \n",
    "With a more complicated system, this is no longer the case.\n",
    "This force field describes the energy associated with molecular movements such as bond stretching, angle bending, or dihedral angle rotation.  \n",
    "The force field describes the energies associated with these movements mathematically. The potential energy is commonly represented by the letter $U$, and the total potential energy or \"force field\" is the sum of terms related to bond stretching, angle bending, torsional rotation (that cis-trans isomerism), electrostatic interaction, and nonbonded Van der Waals interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U = U_{bond} + U_{angle} + U_{torsion} + U_{elec} + U_{vdw} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we show commonly used forms from these terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Van der Waals Interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the term we are most familiar with. It is the only type of term we have to use for a Lennard Jones fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_{vdw} = 4\\epsilon_{ij}[(\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}})^{12} - (\\frac{\\sigma_{ij}}{r_{ij}})^{6}] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are non-covalent interactions that occur between all atoms and molecules, irrespective of their charge.\n",
    "$U_{vdw}$ quantifies these weak forces that primarily consist of attractions and repulsions due to transient fluctuations in electron density around atoms.\n",
    "The equation is formulated using the Lennard-Jones potential, which models the balance between attraction at longer distances (represented by the $(\\frac{\\alpha_{ij}}{r_{ij}})^{6}$ term) and repulsion at shorter distances (captured by the $(\\frac{\\alpha_{ij}}{r_{ij}})^{12}$ term).\n",
    "Here, $\\epsilon_{ij}$ provides the depth of the potential well, indicating the strength of the attraction, and $\\alpha_{ij}$ represents the finite distance at which the inter-particle potential is zero.\n",
    "As two atoms approach each other, they first attract weakly, then strongly, but once they get too close, they experience a strong repulsive force.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonds and Angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_{bond} = \\frac{1}{2}k_{l}(l-l_{eq})^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_{angle} = \\frac{1}{2}k_{\\theta}(\\theta - \\theta_{eq})^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that both bonds and angles are commonly described using a harmonic potential (also used to describe spring-mass systems.) \n",
    "This should look familiar to your last homework assignment!\n",
    "The variable $l$ represents the distance between two bonded atoms. The parameters $k_{l}$ and $l_{eq}$ represent the bond stiffness and equilibrium bond length respectively. \n",
    "For example, two double bonded carbons will have a shorter bond length ($l_{eq}$) and stiffer bond (stiffer spring, or higher $k_{l}$) than single bonded carbons.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Torsional (Dihedral) Interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_{torsion} = \\sum_{n=1}^{n_{max}}{U_{n}[1+cos(n\\phi-\\gamma_{n})]} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The torsion energy, represented by $U_{torsion}$, describes the energy changes associated with the rotation around a particular bond, often visualized between four bonded atoms in sequence.\n",
    "This term is especially significant in cases like rotatable single bonds where molecules can adopt different conformations based on the dihedral angles.\n",
    "The variable $\\phi$ represents the torsional (or dihedral) angle, which is the angle between two intersecting planes formed by three atoms each.\n",
    "The parameters $U_{n}$ and $\\gamma_{n}$ provide amplitude and phase shift respectively.\n",
    "This trigonometric expression captures the periodic nature of torsional potentials, indicating that after completing a full rotation (360°), the molecule returns to its original state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electrostatic Interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_{elec} = k_{e}\\frac{q_{i}q_{j}}{r_{ij}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $U_{elec}$ encapsulates the interactions between charged species within a molecular system.\n",
    "As the name suggests, it's based on the fundamental principles of electrostatics: opposite charges attract, while like charges repel.\n",
    "The variables $q_{i}$ and $q_{j}$ represent the charges on atoms i and j, respectively, and $r_{ij}$ is the distance between them.\n",
    "The constant $k_{e}$ is a proportionality factor that relates to the physical constants of the system.\n",
    "In essence, this term is a manifestation of Coulomb's Law at the molecular level, accounting for the forces exerted between charged entities in the molecule.\n",

    "View the [OpenMM repository](https://github.com/openmm/openmm) and answer the following questions.\n",
    "1. What language or languages is OpenMM written in? Why do you think this is? Did you notice any performance differences compared to the Lennard Jones calculator we used in ASE last week?\n",
    "2. Read the C++ [harmonic bond class](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/blob/a97bbeb40f60acefebb8a6feb0e2522c758d0db0/openmmapi/include/openmm/HarmonicBondForce.h#L50) in OpenMM. Using what you have learned about C++ classes already, explain the attributes and methods present in the class. Identify the construtor. Identify public and private variables and methods. What does this class represent? Is there anything in the class that you don't understand? \n",
    "3. Read the Python [topology class](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/blob/e2453f5ec1fc1fd7916e0b398033c3e9ed341877/wrappers/python/openmm/app/topology.py#L70) and perform the same exercise. Using what you have learned about Python classes, identify different aspects of the class. Where is the constructor defined and wht does it do? What are the class attributes and methods? Is there anything in the class that you don't understand?\n",
